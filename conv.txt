Property				Unit					Convention
Distance (Position, Size, Movement)	Pixels					The world is measured in pixels. Each unit = 1 pixel.
Direction (Rotation, Angles)		Radians					Rotation is stored in radians (0 to 2œÄ). 0 rad = Right (East), œÄ/2 = Down (South).
Rotation Direction			Counterclockwise			Positive values rotate counterclockwise, negative rotates clockwise.
Velocity (Linear, Angular)		Pixels per frame, Radians per frame	Movement is measured in pixels per frame, rotation in radians per frame.
Time					Frames					All time-based values (cooldowns, decay, movement, lifespan) are in frames.
Mass					Arbitrary mass units			Mass = area (density = 1), meaning bigger creatures have more inertia.
Energy					Arbitrary energy units			1 unit of energy ‚âà 1 frame of basic survival.
Simulation Step Time			1 frame = 1/30 sec			Default simulation runs at 30 FPS.

üìç Coordinate System
Axis					Direction
X-axis					Increases to the right (East)
Y-axis					Increases downward (South)
Rotation (Œ∏ = 0 rad)			Points Right (East)
üîÑ Physics Conventions
Property				Unit					Convention
Linear Velocity				Pixels per frame			velocity = [vx, vy] (movement per frame in X, Y)
Angular Velocity			Radians per frame			angular_velocity (rotation per frame)
Rotational Inertia (I)			Mass √ó (distance¬≤)			Œ£(m √ó r¬≤) (based on Center of Mass)
Force Application			Global Space				Forces are applied in world coordinates, not relative to the creature.
Flipper Force				Pixels/frame¬≤				Applied in the direction the creature is facing.
Collision Bounces			Mass & Momentum-Based			Uses mass ratio for velocity exchange.
Friction / Drag				Velocity decay per frame		Slowly reduces momentum over time.
