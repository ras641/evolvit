Hi this ras641 or Ryan submitting for reddists hackathon 2025

This is a virtual world filled with these creatures, each made up of a customizable set of organs like eyes, mouths, flippers, and spikes.

They eat with mouths, move with flippers and attack other creatures with spikes

You'll see here you can see their names and energy

And here you can optionally view it in 3d

They swpawn with 50 out of 100 energy and when they reach 100 they lose 60 and reproduce.

All creatures lose health over time and flippers and spikes lose even more based on their size

The offspring is usually mutated form its parent sometimes its cloned

Its all contained within 500x500 pixels and wraps


This is the introduction screen

Here users can edit and upload there own creature with their own organs which will appear in the world.

Here is some basic info about the app

Here is some more detailed and technical information.



If we view world again youll see the creature I just made has been placed into the world in a random location

Creatures I made come with this tophat and I may make it an in-app purchase at some point to pay for servers

Future improvements may include a grid system to expand the world, editable simple brains and other organs like splicers and blinkers

Thankyou for listening
